# pro-e-shop-heroku

This repo contains an e-commerce platform I built while learning React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`
This runs both the client and server concurrently.

### `npm run server` and `npm run client`
Alternatively, you can run the server and client separately using the above commands.
